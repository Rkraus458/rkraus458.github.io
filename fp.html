         <h1>Final Project</h1>
      <p>Underneath is my final project that I created with Nathan. We recreated the addicting game known as Flappy Bird <br>
          What we decided to do for our final is known as the addicting game called Flappy Bird. We first started off with the background which I used multiple for loops to create a skyline, bushes and clouds.<br>
          We also used a for loop for the foreground of the tube. Then we got to the game code, first we inserted the khan button class so we could switch through our scenes. <br>
          To make the moving pipes we used a draw method which actually drew the pipes and then made the x and y positions interchangeable. Then we had an array holding the pipes while the for loop creates new ones at random spots and sizes.<br>
          Then we had to make the pipe's collision code so when the bird hits the pipe the ending scene comes up. For the collision model we just used if statements and boolean expressions to see if they hit or not. <br>
          If that's true the ending scene comes up asking if I want to restart or quit and each of those buttons just changes the scenes back to the already existing scenes. <br>
          Then finally we make the physics for the bird and the pipes to actually move. Then you have a flappy bird. All you have to do is click away and avoid the pipes.
